# LlamaIndex RAG Examples

This repository contains example implementations of different RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approaches using LlamaIndex.

## 1. GraphRAG Implementation
Source code for the article [GraphRAG vs. Baseline RAG: Solving Multi-Hop Reasoning in LLMs](https://www.genui.com/resources/graphrag-vs.-traditional-rag-solving-multi-hop-reasoning-in-llms)

This example demonstrates how to implement GraphRAG, an advanced RAG approach that excels at multi-hop reasoning tasks

## 2. Simple Vector Index RAG
Source code for the article [Building a custom RAG pipeline with LlamaIndex and Llama3.2](https://www.genui.com/resources/building-a-custom-rag-pipeline-with-llamaindex-and-llama3.2)

This example shows how to build a custom RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex with Llama 3.2.

## Choosing an Example

- If you're interested in handling complex, multi-hop queries that require connecting information from multiple sources, check out the **GraphRAG Example**.
- If you're looking to build a straightforward RAG system with vector embeddings, or specifically want to use Groq's LLM, check out the **Simple Vector Index Example**.
