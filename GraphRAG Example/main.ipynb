      "That will give Verdane not only the stake in Meltwater, but also a stake in Jobylon and whatever else Fountain and Lyseggen find interesting. That will, in turn, de-leverage a focus on just one business. Verdane itself has only recently started to spread its wings to invest in startups across all of Europe and beyond: tying up with a partner to help direct it is a very de-risked approach to take while trying to be more ambitious.\\n\\nIn terms of technology, companies like Meltwater are at a crossroads these days. The company would have had its roots out of the businesses where humans would have physically sifted through piles of newspapers, daily, to clip mentions of a company’s name, collate those and send them on to those clients to help them better track how they are being covered in the media.\\n\\nThe decline of print media digitized that effort, and then the rise of social media turned that into a wider game, sentiment analysis, and words became structured, and more usually unstructured data. The influx of a whole new set of tools to glean insight out of that data turned a media challenge into a technical one. Meltwater built AI in-house and has acquired a stream of businesses in an analytics consolidation play. (The most high-profile of these acquisitions undoubtedly was DataSift, the groundbreaking firm that was an early friend of Twitter’s in monetizing its firehose only for that relationship to turn sour.)\\n\\nBut now, it has a much bigger competitive threat: Companies like OpenAI and innovations in generative AI will change the game again in terms of search — consumer and enterprise — and how any kind of business intelligence work gets carried out.\\n\\nLyseggen, unsurprisingly, believes that although Meltwater’s focus feels a bit like a throwback to a problem that has now essentially been fixed — and may well be made more efficient by would-be competitors — he thinks there is more opportunity for his company regardless.\\n\\n“I consider OpenAI’s ChatGPT the ‘Netscape moment’ in ushering in this new era,” he said. That’s an interesting thing to say: Netscape certainly changed how the world looks for information, although it’s far from being part of what we use today. “AI is changing the game for players to challenge the old guard. I think Meltwater’s tech stock is already the most modern and AI-centric in its category. We will continue to invest in AI and that’s something we are very excited about. We are pushing very hard.” Meltwater today says it analyzes around 1 billion documents daily for clients in communications, marketing and PR.\"\n",

      "\"body\": \"The political deal clinched by European Union lawmakers late Friday over what the bloc is billing as world’s first comprehensive law for regulating artificial intelligence includes powers for the Commission to adapt the pan-EU AI rulebook to keep pace with developments in the cutting edge field, it has confirmed.\\n\\nLawmakers’ choice of term for regulating the most powerful models behind the current boom in generative AI tools — which the EU Act refers to as “general purpose” AI models and systems, rather than using industry terms of choice, like “foundational” or “frontier” models — was also selected with an eye on futureproofing the incoming law, per the Commission, with co-legislators favoring a generic term to avoid a classification that could be chained to use of a specific technology (i.e. transformer based machine learning).\\n\\n“In the future, we may have different technical approaches. And so we were looking for a more generic term,” a Commission official suggested today. “Foundation models, of course, are part of the general purpose AI models. These are models that can be used for a very large variety of tasks, they can also be integrated in systems. To give you a concrete example, the general purpose AI model would be GPT-4 and the general purpose AI system would be ChatGPT — where GPT-4 is integrated in ChatGPT.”\\n\\nAs we reported earlier, the deal agreed by the bloc’s co-legislators includes a low risk tier and a high risk tier for regulating so-called general purpose AIs (GPAIs) — such as models behind the viral boom in generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The trigger for high risk rules to apply on generative AI technologies is determined by an initial threshold set out in the law.\\n\\nAlso as we reported Thursday, the agreed draft of the EU AI Act references the amount of compute used to train the models, aka floating point operations (or FLOPs) — setting the bar for a GPAI to be considered to have “high impact capabilities” at 10^25 FLOPs.\\n\\nBut during a technical briefing with journalists today to review the political deal the Commission confirmed this is just an “initial threshold”, affirming it will have powers to update the threshold over time via implementing/delegating acts (i.e. secondary legislation). It also said the idea is for the FLOPs threshold to be combined, over time, with “other benchmarks” that will be developed by a new expert oversight body to be set up within the Commission, called the AI Office.\\n\\nWhy was 25 FLOPs selected as the high risk threshold for GPAIs?\n",

      "ChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts. Writers everywhere rolled their eyes at the new technology, much like artists did with OpenAI’s DALL-E model, but the latest chat-style iteration seemingly broadened its appeal and audience.\\n\\nFAQs:\\n\\nWhat is ChatGPT? How does it work?\\n\\nChatGPT is a general-purpose chatbot that uses artificial intelligence to generate text after a user enters a prompt, developed by tech startup OpenAI. The chatbot uses GPT-4, a large language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text.\\n\\nWhen did ChatGPT get released?\\n\\nNovember 30, 2022 is when ChatGPT was released for public use.\\n\\nWhat is the latest version of ChatGPT?\\n\\nBoth the free version of ChatGPT and the paid ChatGPT Plus are regularly updated with new GPT models. The most recent model is GPT-4.\\n\\nCan I use ChatGPT for free?\\n\\nThere is a free version of ChatGPT that only requires a sign-in in addition to the paid version, ChatGPT Plus.\\n\\nWho uses ChatGPT?\\n\\nAnyone can use ChatGPT! More and more tech companies and search engines are utilizing the chatbot to automate text or quickly answer user questions/concerns.\\n\\nWhat companies use ChatGPT?\\n\\nMultiple enterprises utilize ChatGPT, although others may limit the use of the AI-powered tool.\\n\\nMost recently, Microsoft announced at it’s 2023 Build conference that it is integrating it ChatGPT-based Bing experience into Windows 11. A Brooklyn-based 3D display startup Looking Glass utilizes ChatGPT to produce holograms you can communicate with by using ChatGPT. And nonprofit organization Solana officially integrated the chatbot into its network with a ChatGPT plug-in geared toward end users to help onboard into the web3 space.\\n\\nWhat does GPT mean in ChatGPT?\\n\\nGPT stands for Generative Pre-Trained Transformer.\\n\\nWhat’s the difference between ChatGPT and Bard?\\n\\nMuch like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Bard is a chatbot that will answer questions in natural language. Google announced at its 2023 I/O event that it will soon be adding multimodal content to Bard, meaning that it can deliver answers in more than just text, responses can give you rich visuals as well. Rich visuals mean pictures for now, but later can include maps, charts and other items.\\n\\nChatGPT’s generative AI has had a longer lifespan and thus has been “learning” for a longer period of time than Bard.\\n\\nWhat is the difference between ChatGPT and a chatbot?\\n\\nA chatbot can be any software/system that holds dialogue with you/a person but doesn’t necessarily have to be AI-powered. For example, there are chatbots that are rules-based in the sense that they’ll give canned responses to questions.\\n\\nChatGPT is AI-powered and utilizes LLM technology to generate text after a prompt.\\n\\nCan ChatGPT write essays?\\n\\nYes.\\n\\nCan ChatGPT commit libel?\\n\\nDue to the nature of how these models work, they don’t know or care whether something is true, only that it looks true. That’s a problem when you’re using it to do your homework, sure, but when it accuses you of a crime you didn’t commit, that may well at this point be libel.\\n\\nWe will see how handling troubling statements produced by ChatGPT will play out over the next few months as tech and legal experts attempt to tackle the fastest moving target in the industry.\\n\\nDoes ChatGPT have an app?\\n\\nYes, there is now a free ChatGPT app that is currently limited to U.S. iOS users at launch. OpenAi says an android version is “coming soon.”\\n\\nWhat is the ChatGPT character limit?\\n\\nIt’s not documented anywhere that ChatGPT has a character limit. However, users have noted that there are some character limitations after around 500 words.\\n\\nDoes ChatGPT have an API?\\n\\nYes, it was released March 1, 2023.\\n\\nWhat are some sample everyday uses for ChatGPT?\\n\\nEveryday examples include programing, scripts, email replies, listicles, blog ideas, summarization, etc.\\n\\nWhat are some advanced uses for ChatGPT?\\n\\nAdvanced use examples include debugging code, programming languages, scientific concepts, complex problem solving, etc.\\n\\nHow good is ChatGPT at writing code?\\n\\nIt depends on the nature of the program.\n",

How can the government support those striving against an increasingly insecure (and insincere) backdrop?\\n\\nThe response of any tech company impacted by last week’s news surely has to be this.\\n\\nFirst, we need a consistent macroeconomic policy. This has a major impact on startups raising and deploying capital into climate R&D. The global economic contraction has made it difficult for these businesses to raise any money. Overall approaches to the economy have trickle-down effects on how we, as businesses, make money and run our operations. Right down to salaries, which alone are hard to keep up with inflation-based pay rises.\\n\\nThe second is a consistent tax policy. One of the most critical things for startups is research and development (R&D) tax credits. This was a lifeline that gave small, research-intensive companies months of budget runway every year, as it effectively saw them get a third of the money spent in R&D back. The government announced it would be scrapping that last year, and it is only thanks to a lobbying effort spearheaded by the Startup Coalition that, at the last minute, a portion of that tax credit was able to be preserved.\\n\\nWhich leads to the third and most important point: A consistent climate policy. The impact of not having one is playing out in real time, right now. Sunak’s public U-turn doesn’t just undermine science and play into the hands of the climate skeptics. It also plows headlong into the future of any climate tech company whose launch plans have to be aligned around decarbonization timelines. This will damage economic confidence. People will lose jobs. And action, alas, will be further delayed.\\n\\nIn the end, it’s simple: Inconsistency breeds uncertainty. So give us consistency. It is possible for our sector to succeed in spite of bad policies. But to thrive, we need consistent resolutions and behavior from a government that actually cares about leading in this critical fight. Given the colossal stakes, which were at least recently taken seriously, is that really asking too much?\"\n",

      "Steam deck oled -> Comes with -> Extra-long charging cable\n",
      "\n",
      "The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz. The new model squeezes a 7.4-inch OLED screen into the same space, significantly shrinking the bezels around the display. The new panel runs at the same resolution, but with a refresh rate of up to 90Hz. It’s also HDR, covering 110 percent of the P3 color space with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits — the old model maxed out at around 400 nits. Like all OLED screens, it has pure blacks and near-instantaneous response times. As before, anti-glare etched glass is available, but only on the premium model.\\n\\nThe Steam Deck OLED has a die-shrunk version of the same custom APU found in the original Steam Deck. The new APU is produced on a 6nm process, rather than the older 7nm process. Manufacturers typically use die-shrinks to either improve performance or efficiency, and Valve has chosen the latter. The max frequency of both the GPU and CPU are identical between the LCD and OLED models, so for developers tuning their games for Steam Decks, they only have a single performance target.\\n\\nIn concert with the more-efficient processor, there’s also a 25 percent larger battery with a 50Whr capacity, compared to the original’s 40Whr. According to Valve, these changes combined result in a 30-50 percent increase in longevity between the two generations — the official battery life claim is \\\"three to 12 hours.\\\" In our review, we measured a playtime increase of 62 percent when playing Hades on the OLED model versus our 18-month-old original. (Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\\n\\nThe new internals make the Steam Deck OLED marginally lighter, and also cooler to the touch when playing games, aided by a slightly larger fan. Other improvements include support for both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, together with a new antenna array that will give a better experience when using both at the same time. There’s also a reworked power supply (it has a logo now!) with a longer 2.5m cable that will charge the OLED model from 20 to 80 percent in “as little as 45 minutes.” The thumbsticks have also been made 1mm taller, and the touch pads' haptics are slightly sharper.\\n\\nValve\\n\\nThe Steam Deck OLED starts at $549, and will replace all but the entry-level model in the range. The immediate reality is a bit of a mess and a little complicated, but this, Valve says, will be the Steam Deck line-up moving forward:\\n\\n256GB Steam Deck LCD ($399)\\n\\n512GB Steam Deck OLED ($549)\\n\\n1TB Steam Deck OLED ($649)\\n\\nAs a result of the changes, the 64GB LCD Steam Deck (previously sold at $399) will drop to $349, and the 512GB LCD (previously $649) will drop to $499. Once Valve sells through its inventory of both, those lines will be discontinued. Valve says it will continue to support all LCD models with software updates.\\n\\nSo, the long-term lineup starts at the same $399 price, which gets you the old LCD Steam Deck, but with 256GB of storage instead of 64GB. The new step-up model costs $20 more at $549, but comes with an OLED display and the improvements outlined above, plus double the storage. The range still tops out at $649, but you’re getting a lot more for your money: All of the hardware improvements, 1TB of storage instead of 512GB and an improved carry case that can pop out into a slimmer shell that’s smaller and easier to fit in a bag. As mentioned, it also has the same anti-glare etched glass as the outgoing 512GB LCD model.\\n\\nFinally, there’s also a Limited Edition version of the 1TB model, with a translucent shell and a customized carry case, which will be sold at $679. We imagine stocks will not last very long, as it looks pretty rad:\\n\\nValve\\n\\nWhile there are no concrete updates on future hardware developments, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais noted that, so long as interest in handheld gaming remains high, the company has \\\"plans for successive generations of handhelds.\\\" For now, Griffais explained, it's important to Valve that developers don't need to \\\"split their attention\\\" between different performance targets.\\n\\nWhen asked about the potential for future hardware — like a return of the Steam Machine or an updated Steam Controller — there were no firm updates, but there does seem to be something happening.\n",

      "42 per cent of banks -> Expecting -> Non-food industry credit growth above 12 per cent\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of 24 banks including public sector, private sector and foreign banks participated in the survey. These banks together represent about 79 per cent of the banking industry, as classified by asset size.\\n\\nThe Indian economy posted an impressive 7.2 per cent growth in the financial year ended March 2023 and 7.8 per cent in first quarter of current fiscal year. Credit growth also continued to rise, signalling robust demand conditions in the Indian economy, as well as banks' improved appetite towards retail borrowers.\\n\\nThe health of the banking sector has witnessed an encouraging turnaround, marked by healthier bank balance sheets and gross NPA ratio at a decade low.\\n\\nThe survey findings show that long term credit demand has seen continued growth in sectors such as Infrastructure, textiles and chemicals. food processing and metals.\\n\\nIron & steel have also witnessed accelerated long-term loan disbursements in the past six months. Infrastructure is witnessing an increase in credit flow with 67 per cent of the respondents indicating an increase in long-term loans as against 57 per cent in the previous round.\\n\\nThe survey suggests that the outlook on expectation on growth of non-food industry credit over next six months is optimistic with 42 per cent of the participating banks expecting non-food industry credit growth to be above 12 per cent (as compared to 36 per cent in the previous round).\\n\\nRajan Jain, Head, Credit Research, SBI Caps, said in a note that whether the yield curve dynamics mean the US is moving to a structurally higher-rate economy vs. post GFC normal remains a moot question, with important implications for investment demand and system risk.\\n\\nThese movements have had a cascading effect on global economies, which have seen routs in their respective bond markets, besides a fresh round of currency depreciation.\\n\\nEmerging market economies with large volumes of USD denominated debt are especially vulnerable as they could be caught in a vicious circle of their external debt (in local currency terms) ballooning due to strong DXY and their servicing ability being impaired by tepid economic activity owing to high rates. Even advanced economies have felt the heat, and the ECB etc. have maintained a hawkish narrative, Jain said.\\n\\nAnother developing story seems to be the greenshoots of recovery in China backed by domestic consumption in the Golden week, and tourism related to the Asian Games. For now, these seem to buttressed on stimulus and base effects as China is now fully open.\\n\\nThe long-term trajectory remains to be seen. In any case, for now this has provided a floor for commodity prices, especially base metals. Fickle commodity prices will also be victims of fresh geopolitical tensions in West Asia, which has pushed up Brent crude. Food prices could also play truant with climate change affecting cropping area worldwide: sugar and rice prices are booming, the note said.\\n\\nIn this challenging environment, Indian real GDP growth, estimated to be 6.2 per cent y/y in real terms in FY24, is resilient. High frequency indicators suggest strong construction and infrastructure activity, and soaring urban demand.\\n\\nManufacturing production has been unusually strong in Q2FY24, especially in infrastructure-oriented structures such as cement and steel. Power supply grew vastly in Q2 after a tepid Q1, helped by a dry August 2023 and buzzing industrial activity.\\n\\nBoth the Union and States have front ended capex in H1FY24, and this remains the engine of expansion. Capital expenditure was up 48 per cent y/y for the Union in the same period. Reports suggest capex of major states was also up 45 per cent y/y in 5MFY24.\\n\\nCarrying forward this capex in H2FY24 would be important to sustain the multiplier. The fiscal deficit for the 5MFY24 stood at 36% of the FY24BE. Gross direct tax revenue experienced a substantial increase of 18 per cent y/y up to October 9, allaying concerns of fiscal slippage, the note said.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "You can even boil live betting down to the results of the next possession.\\n\\nThe most popular sportsbook apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM, offer NBA in-game betting, though each has its lines and betting opportunities.\\n\\nWhat makes NBA betting special or unique?\\n\\nBasketball odds are known to fluctuate more than those of other sports. The factors that play into those lines shifting can range from having only a few impact players per team to the sheer frequency of games.\\n\\nBy following a single team, you can track its momentum swings, which players tend to get on hot or cold streaks, or how well they play at home vs. on the road. You can use that information to your advantage for both pre-game and live wagers.\\n\\nSimilar categories of moneylines, spreads, totals, and NBA prop bets should appear across both formats.\\n\\nThe NBA is also special because of the number of bets available for every game, ranging from pre-game to live betting and parlays.\\n\\nWhen you add up the standard bets, game props, player props, in-game betting, and more, there’s a staggering volume of bets for every NBA game at online sportsbooks.\\n\\nSee more: Best NCAA basketball betting sites\\n\\n2023-24 NBA Season\\n\\nOctober 24 Regular season begins November 3 - December 9 In-season tournament February 16-18 All-Star Weekend 2024 April 14 Regular season ends April 16-19 Play-in tournament April 20 Playoffs begin June 6 NBA Finals Game 1\\n\\nNBA spreads, money lines, and over/unders\\n\\nFor anyone new to NBA betting, the staple wager types are:\\n\\nNBA point spreads: Bet on games via margins of victory or loss. Say the New York Knicks are -7.5 favorites over the Miami Heat. That means the Knicks need to win the game by 8 points to win a spread bet. On the other hand, the Heat can lose by up to 7 points (or win outright).\\n\\nNBA moneylines: The simplest form of betting. You pick the winner of the game, and if you’re right, you’ll get paid out based on the odds when you finalize your bet slip. Favorites to win the game are shown negative odds, such as -135, while the underdogs will have positive odds, like +165.\\n\\nNBA over/under bets: Also known as totals. These bets are focused on the combined point total of the two teams playing in a game. (Winners and losers don’t matter.) For example, the over/under could be set at 211.5 points in the Knicks vs. Heat matchup. If you were to pick the over on the bet, you’d need the two teams to combine for 212 points or more to win. They need to score 211 points or fewer if you went with the under.\\n\\nNBA props and futures\\n\\nNBA player and team props are growing in popularity. Sportsbooks are taking note and providing more NBA props than ever.\\n\\nAfter all, it’s much easier to focus on a single player and how he will perform than the entire team. Player props could focus on how many points a player scores or how many rebounds he pulls down. These are typically provided in an over/under format.\\n\\nThen, team props can range from which team will score the first bucket to the total points scored in a quarter to which team will lead at halftime. The selection is often robust, especially when high-profile teams play.\\n\\nFutures bets are exactly what their name implies: bets on events that will happen in the future. Common futures markets include:\\n\\nand much more. You can usually bet on NBA futures odds throughout the year, including well before the season starts and throughout the regular season. The further away from the event, the more likely you will find heavier odds in your favor.\\n\\nIs NBA betting legal in the U.S.?\\n\\nIn the US, the landscape of sports betting, specifically NBA betting, has evolved considerably. While NBA betting is permitted, its legality varies across the nation. The significant turning point came in 2018 when the US Supreme Court made a pivotal decision. It overturned a longstanding federal law and allowed individual states the autonomy to determine their own sports betting regulations.\\n\\nThis groundbreaking decision sparked a wave of change. Since that landmark ruling, over 30 states have embraced sports betting, including wagers on the NBA. For those residing or visiting betting-friendly states, the experience promises fairness and security.\\n\\nState-regulated online betting platforms are in place, ensuring that bettors receive fair odds.\n",

      "October 3 You’ve read the book, you’ve seen the film – Tracks – but here is the story of Robyn Davidson’s life from childhood, largely avoiding that trip across the desert with her camels, and beyond to a life of more travel, houses, lovers and family. Particularly family, and particularly her mother, who took her own life at 46 and about whom Davidson has been unable previously to write to her own satisfaction. She is acutely aware that her version of the truth “can bury another’s”, but this one is hers.\\n\\nStone Yard Devotional\\n\\nCharlotte Wood, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 Another reckoning with a mother’s death, this time in a novel from the sure hands of Charlotte Wood. A woman arrives at some sort of religious community having turned her back on her husband, their life and the metropolis. What is she fleeing and what are her demons? It’s not all peace and tranquillity in the community, which has collective crises to deal with, while her previous life won’t leave her alone. Written in a spare prose, the consistently brilliant Wood delivers yet again. Will Murdoch help Trump again? Credit: The New York Times\\n\\nThe Fall: The End of the Murdoch Empire\\n\\nMichael Wolff, The Bridge Street Press, $34.99. Out now One thing you can be sure of in a Michael Wolff book is plenty of controversial detail and quotes that are not always fully substantiated and sourced. The American writer has tackled the Donald Trump White House in three books, and now turns his attention back to Rupert Murdoch, about whom he has already written a couple. In this latest volume, he turns his blowtorch on Fox News and the recently retired Murdoch, two players who had massive roles in getting Trump into power. Next year? Surely not.\\n\\nMy Life as a Jew\\n\\nMichael Gawenda, Scribe, $35. October 3 The former Age editor-in-chief, a left-wing secular Jew, has written a powerful, moving and personal exploration of his roots and the meaning of his life in Australia today – “the Jew I was, the Jew I am, and the Jew I am becoming”. It begins with a frank account of why he ended his long friendship with former publisher Louise Adler over an essay she commissioned about the so-called Israel Lobby, and a public letter about coverage of Israel. But there is much more – memoir, history and literature – in this brave book. Laura Jean McKay has written a new book of short stories. Credit: Brendan Lodge\\n\\nGunflower: Stories\\n\\nLaura Jean McKay, Scribe, $29.99. October 3 Laura Jean McKay won the richest writing prize in the country during the pandemic for her timely novel The Animals in that Country about a virulent virus that allowed infected people to understand what animals were saying. She was quickly called prescient, but whether that label sticks in her return to the short story remains to be seen. This collection, written over 20 years, again features plenty of animal life in stories ranging in length from one page to 20. If you haven’t read her, now’s the time to start. Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon\\n\\nMichael Lewis, Allen Lane, $55. October 3 This is the astonishing story of Sam Bankman-Fried, the young man who set up his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, in 2019 and three years later was rolling in money.\\n\\nBut when the crypto world went pear-shaped, Bankman-Fried’s business hit an irreversible tailspin, and now he’s facing multiple charges and due in court on October 3. If anyone can be relied on to tell this story of a financial Icarus with verve and narrative flair, it’s Michael Lewis, author of Liar’s Poker, Moneyball, and The Big Short. No doubt the updated edition will have the verdict on SBF. The Woman in Me\\n\\nBritney Spears, Simon & Schuster, $49.99. October 25 The huge-selling American singer has negotiated the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in her 41 years, but at the heart of this book – said to have earned her a $US15 million ($23.3 million) advance – is the controversial “conservatorship” by which her father and others were given almost complete control of her life, but still failed to stop it going off the rails many times.\\n\\nSure to be a bestseller, the book is described as a candid account of her life – exactly what her fans want.

      "Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\\n\\n“How much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?” asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. “This trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.”\\n\\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried’s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm. According to the SEC, FTX was a fraud “from the start,” diverting customers’ funds to Alameda.\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud “from the start,” the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges — with a “multi-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.” Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\\n\\n“Really just old-fashioned embezzlement.”\\n\\nWhat’s left of FTX is now being led by John J. Ray III — you may remember him as the guy who cleaned up Enron and who also said FTX is worse than Enron. Just before the trial began, the FTX lawyers filed suit against Bankman-Fried’s parents, saying they should give back millions of dollars they got from their kid. Ray has also referred to Bankman-Fried’s conduct as “really just old-fashioned embezzlement.”\\n\\nWe have some inkling of what the government will be arguing thanks to the filings prosecutors are making in this case. They argue that Bankman-Fried lied about consumer protection and that Bankman-Fried’s statements that FTX was “avoiding or managing conflicts of interest” and that “as a general principle FTX segregates customer assets from its own assets across our platforms” were lies, in a superseding indictment filed August 14th.\\n\\nThe indictment also says that there were special features in FTX’s code that “permitted Alameda to spend and withdraw unlimited amounts of money from FTX,” which were created at Bankman-Fried’s direction. That effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, “Bankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.”\\n\\nBankman-Fried is accused of using “billions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits” to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda’s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren’t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\\n\\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto — the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry. He was also very interested in publicity, sitting for many interviews both before and after the fall of FTX. The quick rise of FTX as an industry force was at least in part due to Bankman-Fried’s appetite for attention. Here are the hits:\\n\\nBankman-Fried gave interviews freely — and quickly rose to public prominence in the industry. Though FTX hadn’t been in the business as long as competing exchanges such as Coinbase, Kraken, or Gemini, Bankman-Fried positioned himself as an important, boyish face for crypto. (At one point, Bankman-Fried told a colleague at FTX that “I honestly think it’s negative EV [this may mean “expected value,” as in poker] for me to cut my hair. I think it’s important for people to think I look crazy.”)\\n\\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial — the part where the government must prove intent.\\n\\nThe first part of proving the government’s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place.\n",

      "First it was “a few hundred million,” then a billion, then even that wasn’t enough. It wasn’t clear how Wang arrived at $65 billion specifically, but he said he’d discussed the number with Bankman-Fried. Other customers didn’t have the same privileges.\\n\\nAlameda also allegedly kept FTX from looking bad by assuming some of its losses. In 2021, FTX was facing a “several hundred million dollar” loss from an exploit in MobileCoin, Wang said. (This seems to have happened in April 2021, though Wang didn’t give a month.) Bankman-Fried directed him to have Alameda take it on instead, because FTX’s balance sheets were visible to investors and Alameda’s weren’t.\\n\\nYesterday, Paradigm Capital’s Matt Huang showed us the balance sheets he received from Bankman-Fried. They didn’t include the loss, which should have been included in the second quarter numbers he’d received — they showed $63 million in trading expenses and $63 million in “other expenses” in that quarter, and an estimated profit of $732 million.\\n\\n“FTX was not fine and assets were not fine.”\\n\\nBy 2022, Alameda’s negative balance on FTX was a cause for concern for Caroline Ellison, Singh, and Wang. They created a spreadsheet to try to figure out how negative Alameda was. The spreadsheet we saw had several pages of attempts to reconcile. Wang figured that Alameda owed FTX about $11 billion. FTX’s revenue at the time was about $1.5 billion.\\n\\nEllison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried met in the Bahamas office. Alameda’s lenders wanted their money back, and Bankman-Fried directed the group to pay back the lenders using FTX customer funds. Bankman-Fried considered shutting down Alameda, and even wrote a long memo about it. But Wang says that in a now-deleted Signal discussion about the memo, he told Bankman-Fried and Singh that they could not shut down Alameda because they couldn’t repay its debt.\\n\\nAnother empty Signal chat, along with its setting to delete messages after a week, was shown to the court. Its members were Ellison, Singh, Wang, and Bankman-Fried.\\n\\nThings happened quickly for Wang in November. Wang and Bankman-Fried determined that about $8 billion in customer money was gone, but on November 7th, Bankman-Fried tweeted “FTX is fine. Assets are fine.” Another tweet in the thread said, “FTX has enough to cover all client holdings.”\\n\\n“FTX was not fine and assets were not fine because FTX did not have enough assets for customer withdrawals,” Wang said.\\n\\nWhile Bankman-Fried can try to blame Ellison for some of the decisions, the code shows she couldn’t have made all the calls\\n\\nFTX went bankrupt on November 11th. On November 12th, Bankman-Fried directed Wang to send customer funds to Bahamanian regulators, Wang said. At the time, customers couldn’t take their funds off the exchange because FTX had run out of money and its servers had been shut down. Bankman-Fried and his father met with lawyers while Wang waited outside with liquidators. The US lawyers wanted the remaining FTX assets transferred to the US, Wang said.\\n\\nThat is not what he did. Bankman-Fried told Wang to stall the US lawyers and transfer the funds to Bahamanian regulators, who were more likely to let him stay in control of the company, Wang testified.\\n\\nOn November 16th, Wang returned to the US and on November 17th, he met with the US government. Wang hadn’t been arrested or charged; he offered to cooperate immediately. He pled guilty to various charges a month later. Wang was clear: he was cooperating because he didn’t want to go to jail. He was hoping that his assistance means that a sentencing judge will be lenient, he said.\\n\\nThis was the first full account of Alameda’s and FTX’s entanglements I heard in the trial, and it came from a co-owner of both companies. It was striking, though, that while there was evidence of the computer code that gave Alameda special privileges, there was no evidence of the conversations Wang recounted. Of course Wang turned himself in quickly; sooner or later, someone would find his code — and Singh’s, too.\\n\\nIt also struck me that all of Bankman-Fried’s vanishing messages might not help him as much as he’d hoped. He said too many things in public to too many people. Even without the smoking gun of Signal messages, it’s hard to see how he wasn’t involved.\n",

      "Epic -> Has to convince -> Jury\n",
      "\n",
      "In the process they generally engage in myriad well-animated virtual antics as the game has become wackier and more elaborate over time, all while dressed in custom skins you earn by playing or purchase in Epic’s lucrative virtual swag shop.\\n\\nIn its heyday, Fortnite was about as ubiquitous and popular as a game can be. Streaming gameplay routinely drew hundreds of thousands of viewers on Twitch, where a cottage industry of pro Fortnite players emerged, all laser-focused on Epic’s polished battle royale. Epic keeps its metrics under wraps, but back in 2020 the game had more registered players than the population of the United States.\\n\\nEpic’s hit game has both imported and exported popular culture since its launch in 2017. Like other live service online games, Fortnite releases new content every three-ish months, refreshing the destinations scattered across its cartoony island locale, changing the rules of physics and generally adding additional mayhem, often in the form of weapons.\\n\\nThose seasons are punctuated by flashy concerts and pop culture tie-ins, like a psychedelic Ariana Grande show, an in-game lightsaber fight with Darth Vader or the appearance of Dragon Ball Z’s Goku as an in-game skin. The massive online shop for skins and other character customizations betrays Epic’s loftier aspirations of building an interconnected virtual online world — a kind of metaverse, if you will.\\n\\nIn Fortnite, the map is everything. A bad map can ruin a chapter and players often wax nostalgic about in-game locales — usually alliterative hotspots with names like Tilted Towers or Loot Lake. Without a clear glimpse into what Fortnite’s player base looks like these days, it’s tough to know why Epic would decide to go retro and bring the game back to an older save state.\\n\\nIn 2023, Fortnite is far from dead. The game is still very popular, even if it’s not clear exactly how popular. But if Fortnite was once lightning in a bottle, between other free-to-play rivals like Apex Legends, Call of Duty: Warzone and others, that bottle is a lot more crowded these days.\\n\\nNostalgia sells in 2023\\n\\nEpic’s decision to turn back the clock might seem small to anyone who hasn’t dropped in off the Battle Bus, but it’s an interesting reflection of the state of gaming right now. Games — and gamers’ tastes — are increasingly following the wider entertainment trend of digging up familiar stories and repackaging them.\\n\\nGame developers seemed to believe for a time that cutting-edge graphics and hyper-realism were what consumers really wanted, but gamers’ appetites have trended toward retro visuals, nostalgia and familiar game worlds more and more. That lower bar for visual fidelity also opens the doors for inventive indie games that don’t rely on big budgets to shine, but the world’s biggest game developers are riding the wave too.\\n\\nThis year’s hit new Zelda game Tears of the Kingdom literally built a new game on top of the old one and remains a strong contender for Game of the Year. Competition is stiff though, more so now that Nintendo just casually dropped Super Mario Bros. Wonder, the first two-dimensional side-scrolling Mario game in more than a decade — another portal to the past given its departure from a long string of recent 3D Super Mario titles.\\n\\nSquare Enix was so confident in its remake of the 1997 Japanese roleplaying mega-hit Final Fantasy VII that the reimagined version of the game comprises three standalone full-length games, each spaced a few years apart.\\n\\nWorld of Warcraft paved the way\\n\\nFortnite’s experiment to bring players back into the fold by relaunching an original version of the game will be interesting to watch, but it isn’t a first. World of Warcraft, the fantasy roleplaying game once synonymous with online gaming, did something similar just a few years ago. Blizzard Entertainment, which developed the massively multiplayer online game (MMO), launched World of Warcraft Classic back in 2019, even as a modern version of the game remained online and playable.\\n\\nElizabeth Harper, editorial director of the longtime dedicated World of Warcraft news site Blizzard Watch, told TechCrunch that Blizzard actually reluctantly launched the old-school version of its game in response to demands from its own community.\\n\\n“Before WoW Classic originally launched, third parties were already running their own versions of ‘classic’ servers,” Harper said. “Game mechanics and class balance were extremely different then, and there was a lot of nostalgia for the community that existed back in the day.”\\n\\nWhile Fortnite players, like WoW players, have a ton of nostalgia for the older version of the game, its maps were comparably simple and difficult to traverse.\n",

But, as we wait to hear both his version and the government’s version of what happened, there will be another tale recounting how things played out: “Going Infinite,” a book by Michael Lewis chronicling the rise and fall of SBF, is set to debut on the first day of the trial.\\n\\nThe episode has fired up a lot of people, indignant at what they feel was too-easy treatment for someone who many believe brought down the whole crypto house.\\n\\n60 Minutes got rightly community noted here.

Rather, Lewis claims he was introduced to him in early 2021 by a friend who wanted to back FTX. Before any financial commitment, that friend asked Lewis to meet the young billionaire — both lived in Berkeley — to “evaluate his character.”\\n\\nNo, we don’t find out who that friend is, nor do we find out if that particular investment was ever made — SBF did raise some $2 billion, including $1 billion in 2021, from backers that included Sequoia, Temasek, Tiger Global and dozens more.\\n\\nBut we do find out that another investment, of sorts, was made on that day: Lewis himself was so taken with the idea of SBF and his apparent brilliance that he came away with the decision to write about him.\\n\\n“Eighteen months earlier, he had nothing. Now he had $22.5 billion. He was the richest person in the world under 30 [and] he was going to spend it to save humanity from extinction,” he said. “My jaw was on the floor.”\\n\\nThe two proceeded to meet more than 100 times over the next two years. As SBF’s fame and his company’s bank account grew, 60 Minutes itself even got involved. The program shot (and it shows here) one segment with SBF talking as he shuffles cards with his leg twitching nervously behind his desk (why? we don’t find this out, either) as Lewis, with a flourish of his pen and a look of concentration on his face, dashes off notes on his yellow legal pad.\\n\\nLater in the show, you get other behind-the-scenes, unnerving glimpses of how the wizard operated behind the curtain.\n",

      "Alameda research -> Was co-founded by -> Sam bankman-fried\n",
      "\n",
      "Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\\n\\nTwo of Sam Bankman-Fried's former friends from MIT, who also worked at crypto exchange FTX while living with the company's founder in the Bahamas, took the stand in a Manhattan courtroom this week to testify against their former classmate, confidant, and boss — a man who allegedly ran a crypto empire that defrauded thousands of customers out of billions of dollars. Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, \\\"Did you commit financial crimes while working at FTX?\\\" \\\"Yes,\\\" responded Wang. He said that his crimes, including wire and commodities fraud, were carried out with the help of Bankman-Fried, FTX ex-engineering head Nishad Singh and Caroline Ellison, who ran sister hedge fund Alameda Research and had been Bankman-Fried's girlfriend. \\\"Mr. Wang, do you see any of the people you committed those crimes with in the courtroom today?\\\" Roos continued. Wang, dressed in an oversized and wrinkled suit with a red tie and glasses, awkwardly stood up and looked around the courtroom before responding, \\\"Yes.\\\" \\\"Who do you see?\\\" asked Roos. \\\"Sam Bankman-Fried,\\\" he said. The trial, set to last six weeks, will resume on Tuesday with key testimony expected from Ellison, who is considered the prosecution's star witness, having already pleaded guilty to multiple charges. Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Thus far, Bankman-Fried, 31, has remained mostly quiet in court intently listening to witnesses and at times writing notes to his attorneys. But as Wang testified against him, Bankman-Fried looked visibly upset, shifting his gaze from his former friend to the ground, and at one point putting his head in his hands.\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried listens as Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos questions Gary Wang during Bankman-Fried's fraud trial over the collapse of FTX, the bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange, at Federal Court in New York City, U.S., October 6, 2023, in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\\n\\nWang, 30, was technology chief for FTX, which spiraled into bankruptcy in November. He spoke so fast that U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan and the prosecutor both stopped him at points to ask that he slow his pace. Much of Wang's testimony on Friday focused on the final days at FTX before the entire operation imploded, including reports in the media detailing Alameda's business practices and its troubling ties to FTX. Wang said that in response to the reporting an emergency meeting was called between Bankman-Fried, Wang and Singh, to discuss shutting down Alameda. He said they ultimately decided against such a move, because he and Bankman-Fried were aware that Alameda had no way to repay the roughly $14 billion hole in its books. Prosecutors took the jury through a series of tweets, beginning on Nov. 7. Posts came from the company blaming bank hours for slow withdrawals, while Bankman-Fried tweeted from his personal account, assuring customers that all was fine. \\\"FTX was not fine and assets were not fine,\\\" Wang testified. On Nov. 12, after FTX declared bankruptcy, Bankman-Fried asked Wang to drive with him to the Bahamas Securities Commission for a meeting. On the drive, Bankman-Fried told Wang to transfer assets to Bahamian liquidators because he believed they would allow him to maintain control of the company. Wang said he wasn't in the meeting with the securities authority, though Bankman-Fried's dad was present.\\n\\n\\n\\nWang said he returned to the U.S. and met with prosecutors the next day. He faces up to 50 years in prison when he faces a judge for sentencing following this trial. He told jurors he signed a six-page cooperation agreement that requires him to meet with prosecutors, answer their questions truthfully and turn over evidence.\\n\\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is seen during a hearing as a U.S judge revoked his bail, at a courthouse in New York, U.S., August 11, 2023 in this courtroom sketch. Jane Rosenberg | Reuters\\n\\n$65 billion line of credit\\n\\nFor months, Bankman-Fried has known that Wang and Ellison, who were integral members of his personal and professional inner circles, had turned on him. Both pleaded guilty in December and have since been cooperating with the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan.\n",

      "So when we say facilitate, it’s obvious that the EU officials discuss what kind of experts will be available from this particular stakeholder to attend these meetings and to present the point of view, which seems to be a privileged access,” he explained.\\n\\n“Also in the same email thread there’s mention of EU officials being allocated to specifically attend the cooperation between the stakeholder and DG-Home on the proposal, which to our understanding is something that goes way beyond the level of consultations or exchange of views or exchange of opinions on the proposal and speaks directly to cooperation.”\\n\\nThe committee took the opportunity to press Johansson about her contacts with companies and other lobbyists during the drafting of the CSAM-proposal, with MEPs saying they want clear answers to the allegations of commercial interest and heavy lobbying when the Commission was setting up and drafting the proposal.\\n\\nIn the event MEPs got some bare bones detail.\\n\\nAsked for a list of these contacts, the commissioner responded that she’d met with Google six times; Microsoft, Meta and TikTok three times each; twice with Twitter (X); and once apiece with Apple and Amazon. She also said she’d met with the child safety organizations Thorn (twice) and Brave Movement (twice); and with Tech Alliance and ICANN once apiece.\\n\\nIn wider responses related to concerns about how much commercial interest had influenced the Commission, Johansson highlighted her decision for the CSAM-scanning proposal to be “technology neutral” — meaning the draft regulation does not support any specific tech solution — with the suggestion being EU lawmakers had resisted lobbying by companies for a law that would explicitly favor their existing tech tools.\\n\\nShe also denied that only Thorn and Microsoft have technology “that is necessary for the scanning” — claiming that’s “absolutely not true”.\\n\\n“There are no specific technologies mentioned [in the proposal] and I think this is an important part. So there’s no specific technology that’s been favoured in this proposal,” she also told the committee, adding: “So many technologies are being developed all the time — while we are speaking — and they will continue to develop. So I think it’s important that the legislation has to be technology neutral.”\\n\\nEarlier this week a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), an advisory body to the Commission on data protection law, heard from more than 20 speakers across civil society, academia and industry expressing deep misgivings about the Commission’s approach — including a warning from the EDPS himself that the EU could be at a tipping point for freedom and democracy if it does not turn back from the plan to do non-targeted scanning of private messages.\\n\\nJohansson had been invited to participate in the seminar but declined to attend. She didn’t offer a direct response to the EDPS’ concerns today but she did counter a number of arguments heard at the session earlier in the week — including refuting the suggestion that her proposal amounts to mass surveillance.\\n\\n“My proposal would not mean that all communication will be scanned. Compared to the situation today it will be much more limited,” she claimed, referencing the temporary ePrivacy derogation that currently gives messaging firms a legal basis to scan non-encrypted content for CSAM (but is intended to be replaced by the proposed regulation which, critics contend, will force platforms to scan end-to-end encrypted content too). “Today companies are allowed to scan if they search for child sexual abuse material. That’s why we receive these 5.2 million videos and pictures and grooming attempts — 70% from private communication. If my proposal is adopted, this will be limited.”\\n\\nShe also emphasized how the proposal first requires in-scope platforms to deploy prevention measures to try to stop the spread of CSAM and/or prevent abuse of their tools by people intent on abusing children. “First comes prevention. Only if prevention is not enough, then you might be allowed to do detection — but only after a court decision,” she said.\\n\\n“So only those that really cannot deal with the problem with mitigating measures… and only after a court decision and only during a specific period they will be allowed to do the detection,” she went on. “We will also limit the reporting so that we will also receive fewer but hopefully better reports.”\\n\\nJohansson’s arguments to MEPs that her proposal does not overreach also lent on the existence of other EU laws — such as the bloc’s data protection framework — which she suggested will act as balancing checks on the scope of possible CSAM-scanning. “It’s also important that we continue to comply with all relevant legislation. For example the GDPR and other requirements, there are no derogation from that in my proposal,” she said.\\n\\n“It’s also important — and I know that’s been part of the debate — that it should not be a slippery slope,” she added.\n",

      "We do that and we have done that. And I think it’s a good practice to do so. Because we are we are taking stance and we should defend our stance,” she told the committee.\\n\\nA number of MEPs pushed back — including by pointing out that there are more appropriate channels for the Commission to engage directly and transparency with co-legislators than opaque behavioral ad targeting on platforms like Twitter/X.\\n\\n“One principle of democracy is that we have procedures because the end doesn’t justify the means,” opined MEP Sophie in ‘t Veld. “And European Commission has the right to be very attached to its legislative proposals but there are privileged channels for the European Commission to communicate with the two legislators and others — not an ad campaign on Twitter.”\\n\\nDespite a lot of pushback, the committee was unable to extract any other lines from commissioner on the ad campaign. But at the end of the session she did agree to respond to it in writing with some missing answers “as soon as possible” (albeit, avoiding agreeing to do so by the end of the week, as one MEP had asked).\\n\\nCommercial influence\\n\\nWhile many of the questions directed at her over the 1.5-hour long hearing focused on the controversy that’s sprung up around the ad campaign, parliamentarians also pressed the commissioner on a number of other issues — including concerns about the extent of commercial lobbying around the CSAM-scanning proposal.\\n\\nThis has been a topic of intense interest, especially following a report by investigative journalists published last month by BalkanInsight which looked at close contacts between Johansson’s department and companies with CSAM-scanning and other child safety tools to sell.\\n\\nOne of the journalists involved in that investigation, Apostolis Fotiadis, had also been invited by the committee to participate in the exchange of views — and he took the opportunity to defend their reporting from direct public attacks by Johansson.\\n\\nIn a blog post ahead of today’s hearing — which deploys a crisis-PR-esque headline claim of “setting the record straight” — she criticized the article as “a series of insinuations looking for a home”; claiming it paired an outline of “a selection of meetings I had, of events I attended, or conferences I addressed” with “a conspiratorial tone” in an attempt “to create the impression of financial influence where there is none”.\\n\\nFotiadis was asked by the LIBE committee about the accusation that the journalists had, essentially, been spreading disinformation — and specifically whether he believed Johansson and the Commission’s response to it amounted to a restriction on media freedom. He responded by saying he did not think that was the case. But went on to express surprise at how the Commission had reacted to the scrutiny — to its instinct to deploy “spin-doctor” tactics to try to discredit the article, rather than engaging with the substance of the concerns being raised.\\n\\nThe Commission risks straying close to making attacks on journalists by using such tactics, Fotiadis warned — adding: “You cannot just dismiss everything by calling fake news” — before also noting that Johansson’s office had declined multiple interview requests ahead of publication of the article.\\n\\nResponding to a question from the committee about the reporting he said documents obtained by the journalists included email threads between Commission officials in Johansson’s department, DG-Home, and a “key stakeholder” advocating for the use of technology for CSAM-scanning — which indicated what he described as “privileged access” that “speaks directly to cooperation” and goes “way beyond” mere consultation or exchange of views on the proposal.\\n\\n“It’s an official chain discussing invitation, how the stakeholder would be able to allocate experts that would speak in workshops — first attended by representatives of the Member States, and then afterwards actually by ministers in the Council in a meeting chaired by commissioner Johansson.\n",

      "\"body\": \"Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president’s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg’s calculation has consistently been below Trump’s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he’s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his “brand” adds. He also said that banks didn’t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. “They just weren’t a very important element in banks’ decision-making process,” Trump told the court. “And we’ll explain that as this trial goes along.” Here’s a look at New York state’s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg’s own approach to assessing the assets.\\n\\nMar-a-Lago Trump’s valuation (2021): $US612.1 million , Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US240 million, New York’s valuation (2021): $US27.6 million It’s fair to say that Trump’s most famous property these days is no longer New York’s Trump Tower but his Mar-a-Lago Club, the historic Palm Beach estate built by Marjorie Merriweather Post in the 1920s that he now calls home. New York’s valuation of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate has raised eyebrows. Credit: AP The sprawling resort has been at the centre of some publicised post-presidency scandals, from classified documents being kept in one of its bathrooms to the location where Trump is said to have shared nuclear submarine secrets with Australian businessman Anthony Pratt — something that Trump denies.\\n\\nIt’s also a major focus in Trump’s fraud lawsuit. Trump made a series of agreements with Palm Beach County and the National Trust for Historic Preservation for Mar-a-Lago to be used only as a club, giving up any development rights. Consequently, Palm Beach values the property as a business on its tax rolls. In 2021, the county assessed it at $US27.6 million, lower than comparable residential properties. New York State argues that this appraisal is the one Trump should have been using. New York’s estimated value “was a shock to the real estate community and anybody with any understanding of the island and its values,” said Liza Pulitzer, a real estate agent at Brown Harris Stevens and a Palm Beach native. “It could easily fetch $US500 million or more.”\\n\\nThat assumes a buyer views it as a single-family residence. It’s currently not zoned for such use, though Trump is able to reside there through a loophole designating himself an employee. Trump’s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn’t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it’s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status. Historically, Mar-a-Lago never made much money for the Trump Organisation, but that seems to be changing.\n",

      "Techcrunch -> Has been covering -> Technology companies out of palestine\n",
      "\n",
      "For example, according to sources who helped build those bridges, Nvidia, famed for its role in the new AI boom, has been working with at least 100 engineers from the region for years. (Tragically, the initiative to employ Palestinians in this outsourcing was that of Mellanox founder Eyal Waldman, whose daughter was brutally murdered in the attacks by Hamas).\\n\\nSince at least 2008, TechCrunch been covering technology companies out of Palestine, some serving their direct audience, some serving the tech world internationally. Silicon Valley had taken an increasing interest in Palestine as a tech hub, but like the ecosystem itself, it’s nascent: To date, those working in the region estimate that as much as $10 million has been invested in the Palestinian tech ecosystem.\\n\\nNotably, in 2017, Salesforce founder and CEO Marc Benioff joined Silicon Valley luminaries in backing the first-ever coding academy to be created in Gaza.\\n\\nGaza Sky Geeks, an Alphabet-backed initiative based in Gaza that provides pre-seed investments, training and technology resources to Palestine’s Gazan population, has been a beacon of entrepreneurship in the region.\\n\\nAll of that is now effectively gone, like the buildings in Gaza itself.\\n\\nIsrael is currently retaliating militarily against the attacks on its people, on its soil, and the hostages subsequently taken by Hamas — the ruling organization in Gaza that kidnapped at least 150 people and took them into Gaza during brutal attacks on Israel last weekend that killed 1,300 people.\\n\\nThat strategy has seen Israel pummeling the “Gaza Strip” with bombs to eradicate it of Hamas and to get its hostages back. Over 1,500 people in Palestine so far have been killed as a result. The tech industry in Israel — the country’s biggest export and its biggest single contributor to GDP — is also taking a big knock, but inevitably the impact on the smaller and more fragile ecosystem in Gaza has been significantly more serious. The physical, economic and societal destruction resulting from that leaves any future for the tech industry there in doubt.\\n\\nQuite simply, there is no escaping the consequences of the war for anyone, let alone tech workers.\\n\\n“What is happening to tech in Gaza is that Israel is crunching it. Obliterating it,” one source inside the territory told TechCrunch.\\n\\nIsrael has now amassed soldiers near the north of Gaza, ahead of an expected ground offensive into the densely populated enclave. About 1.1 million people living in northern areas have been told to leave in the next day. The UN has warned of “devastating humanitarian consequences” from these latest moves. A total blockade on the territory is being enforced with fuel, food and water running out. Israel says it won’t lift the restrictions unless Hamas frees all hostages.\\n\\nSpeaking to Ryan Sturgill, an American national and former head of the Gaza Sky Geeks (GSG) accelerator run by sponsor Mercy Corps, an NGO aid organization, the situation on the ground appears dire, after waves of shelling by the Israeli military.\\n\\n“The area around the the Mercy Corps building, which housed Gaza Sky Geeks, has been leveled. The structure is standing but blown out. The front of it is sort of ripped off,” he said.\\n\\nGaza Sky Geeks is the largest tech hub in Palestine, providing a wide range of tech training at scale. In 2022, 5,000 coders and developers from across the West Bank and Gaza graduated from the program.\\n\\nVideo evidence (and pictured above) posted on LinkedIn shows a blown-out building with the Mercy Corps sign.\\n\\n“Who knows what’s going to happen. The offices are destroyed, the fiber lines are destroyed. The universities are destroyed. Three main universities in Gaza that produce all the computer science grads are leveled. I don’t even know if people will ever be able to go back to Northern Gaza after what’s happening today.The educational institutions that are there are gone,” Sturgill added.\\n\\nHe had been helping Palestinian tech startups raise capital in the West Bank and Gaza since January.\\n\\n“Until now, there had been a pretty significant growth. A lot of companies in Saudi Arabia have been setting up back offices [in Palestine] for development for all sorts of new companies and even apps that are now growing in the Gulf, because Saudi has been growing so quickly on the tech front. Nvidia, and other international companies, has outsourcing operations in Palestine. Apple has outsourcing operations, Microsoft has R&D, and they would even like to see those expand. There’s companies that had 200 developers sitting in offices in Ramallah,” he said.\\n\\n“I’ve talked to all of the heads of these different offices; most of them are in in Israel.\n",

      "She also decided that Epic violated its developer agreement with Apple and would have to pay.\\n\\nBut she also barred Apple from keeping iPhone users in the dark about alternate ways they can pay for apps – and may have even allowed developers to add their own payment mechanisms. I won’t dwell on the Apple ruling, as I’m ethically bound, but my colleague Adi Robertson has a comprehensive breakdown.\\n\\nHow can Epic possibly have a case against Google when Apple already won?\\n\\nEpic declined to answer this on the record, among other questions we asked... but three things to consider:\\n\\n1) That was a different case. Also, that one’s not over till the Supreme Court weighs in or declines to take a look.\\n\\n2) Google can’t tell jurors that Apple won its case, or that other plaintiffs settled. The judge in this case says so!\\n\\n3) Oh, and by the way, this is a jury trial.\\n\\nWait, why does that matter?\\n\\nEpic and Google have to convince a jury, not the judge, which is totally different from how the Apple case played out. (That one was a “bench trial.”)\\n\\nMaybe all the evidence of tricky deals inside Google might sway a jury against the company? Maybe Google scaremongering that sideloaded apps equal gaping security holes will sway a jury against Epic instead? Who knows!\\n\\n(If you’re a Epic juror reading this — stop! Judge Donato explicitly said you’re in a “news-free bubble” through mid-December, folks.)\\n\\nDidn’t other parties sue Google too?\\n\\nThey did! And then, they all settled. All 50 state attorneys general and a number of consumers have tentatively settled with Google over app store antitrust claims, though it’s not clear what the deal might include.\\n\\nMatch Group, the company behind Tinder, Match.com, OkCupid and other dating apps, just reached a surprise last-minute settlement too, one that makes it sound like Match effectively gave up.\\n\\nEpic stands alone.\\n\\nCould we get a settlement between Google and Epic as well?\\n\\nEpic seems to have no interest in settling as long as the “Google tax” exists, and the company’s repeatedly said it’s not interested in cash. So far, the company’s been willing to push these cases all the way through multiple appeals, cost be damned.\\n\\nIt’s not clear what Google could proactively offer that would satisfy Epic, since CEO Tim Sweeney has also publicly suggested that Google would simply circumvent any settlement it offers.\\n\\nBut if you do want to see a vision of a future that Epic would accept, look no further than this letter it sent to state attorneys general — laying out a settlement that would basically prohibit Google from doing the anticompetitive things that Epic claims it did.\\n\\nThere’s also this tweet from Sweeney:\\n\\nGoogle wouldn’t tell The Verge if it’s offered Epic any kind of settlement yet.\\n\\nWhy if I just want the dirty laundry on both these companies? You promised dirt...\\n\\nOh, it could get good.\\n\\nThe allegations made before trial suggest Google was playing loads of dirty tricks with names like “Project Hug,” “Project Agave,” and “Project Banyan”, with Epic claiming it’s seen evidence Google was paying off game developers and phone makers not to abandon its app store — to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. Google allegedly even toyed with the idea of buying Epic to keep Fortnite from inspiring other game developers to abandon ship.\\n\\nPlus, there’s evidence Google deleted potentially incriminating messages to keep them out of a court’s hands. Enough that the judge has decided to explicitly tell the jury we’re not seeing all the evidence, because Google employees all the way up to CEO Sundar Pichai were caught setting those conversations to auto-delete. This issue has come up in the US v. Google antitrust trial in Washington, DC — still ongoing at the start of Epic’s trial — as well.\\n\\nAnd the dirt isn’t all on Google’s side. Epic was caught straight-up admitting it premeditated the whole plan to bypass Google’s payment systems. Since Google is countersuing over that, it could be a big deal.\\n\\nWhen you say “straight-up admitting...”\\n\\nHere is an email from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney that, I think, speaks for itself:\\n\\n“Here is our official plan for communicating with Google about bypassing the Google Play Store: SAY NOTHING TILL IT SHIPS” Image via Epic v. Apple\\n\\nWe’ll have a whole cast of intriguing people called as witnesses during the trial who might dish even more.\\n\\nWho will Epic and Google call as witnesses?\\n\\nWe are going straight to the top of the org chart, folks.\n",

Made from titanium, it comes in a few different colors and tracks your movements through the day and night to give you a huge data dump in the companion app. The fitness tracking is flaky and the black version scuffs easily, but the four-day battery life is good.\\n\\nThe Whoop 4 is our pick for the most unobtrusive wearable. There's no screen, but it offloads data to the companion app, which tries to guide you toward a healthier lifestyle and boost your fitness levels. The subscription is pricey at $30 per month, but you get a year included with this deal.\\n\\nWe make no bones about it. The Versa 4 is the best Fitbit smartwatch available. In our testing it lived up to its claim of six-day battery life (provided you don't leave the display on the entire time).

      "You can even boil live betting down to the results of the next possession.\\n\\nThe most popular sportsbook apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM, offer NBA in-game betting, though each has its lines and betting opportunities.\\n\\nWhat makes NBA betting special or unique?\\n\\nBasketball odds are known to fluctuate more than those of other sports. The factors that play into those lines shifting can range from having only a few impact players per team to the sheer frequency of games.\\n\\nBy following a single team, you can track its momentum swings, which players tend to get on hot or cold streaks, or how well they play at home vs. on the road. You can use that information to your advantage for both pre-game and live wagers.\\n\\nSimilar categories of moneylines, spreads, totals, and NBA prop bets should appear across both formats.\\n\\nThe NBA is also special because of the number of bets available for every game, ranging from pre-game to live betting and parlays.\\n\\nWhen you add up the standard bets, game props, player props, in-game betting, and more, there’s a staggering volume of bets for every NBA game at online sportsbooks.\\n\\nSee more: Best NCAA basketball betting sites\\n\\n2023-24 NBA Season\\n\\nOctober 24 Regular season begins November 3 - December 9 In-season tournament February 16-18 All-Star Weekend 2024 April 14 Regular season ends April 16-19 Play-in tournament April 20 Playoffs begin June 6 NBA Finals Game 1\\n\\nNBA spreads, money lines, and over/unders\\n\\nFor anyone new to NBA betting, the staple wager types are:\\n\\nNBA point spreads: Bet on games via margins of victory or loss. Say the New York Knicks are -7.5 favorites over the Miami Heat. That means the Knicks need to win the game by 8 points to win a spread bet. On the other hand, the Heat can lose by up to 7 points (or win outright).\\n\\nNBA moneylines: The simplest form of betting. You pick the winner of the game, and if you’re right, you’ll get paid out based on the odds when you finalize your bet slip. Favorites to win the game are shown negative odds, such as -135, while the underdogs will have positive odds, like +165.\\n\\nNBA over/under bets: Also known as totals. These bets are focused on the combined point total of the two teams playing in a game. (Winners and losers don’t matter.) For example, the over/under could be set at 211.5 points in the Knicks vs. Heat matchup. If you were to pick the over on the bet, you’d need the two teams to combine for 212 points or more to win. They need to score 211 points or fewer if you went with the under.\\n\\nNBA props and futures\\n\\nNBA player and team props are growing in popularity. Sportsbooks are taking note and providing more NBA props than ever.\\n\\nAfter all, it’s much easier to focus on a single player and how he will perform than the entire team. Player props could focus on how many points a player scores or how many rebounds he pulls down. These are typically provided in an over/under format.\\n\\nThen, team props can range from which team will score the first bucket to the total points scored in a quarter to which team will lead at halftime. The selection is often robust, especially when high-profile teams play.\\n\\nFutures bets are exactly what their name implies: bets on events that will happen in the future. Common futures markets include:\\n\\nand much more. You can usually bet on NBA futures odds throughout the year, including well before the season starts and throughout the regular season. The further away from the event, the more likely you will find heavier odds in your favor.\\n\\nIs NBA betting legal in the U.S.?\\n\\nIn the US, the landscape of sports betting, specifically NBA betting, has evolved considerably. While NBA betting is permitted, its legality varies across the nation. The significant turning point came in 2018 when the US Supreme Court made a pivotal decision. It overturned a longstanding federal law and allowed individual states the autonomy to determine their own sports betting regulations.\\n\\nThis groundbreaking decision sparked a wave of change. Since that landmark ruling, over 30 states have embraced sports betting, including wagers on the NBA. For those residing or visiting betting-friendly states, the experience promises fairness and security.\\n\\nState-regulated online betting platforms are in place, ensuring that bettors receive fair odds.\n",

      "\n",
      "The only way to see your Facebook posts is to sign up for Facebook’s rules, Facebook’s aesthetic, Facebook’s features, Facebook’s moderation, Facebook’s algorithm, and Facebook’s business model. That’s not just a bad user experience, it’s a ridiculous way to run a company. Facebook has to invent and maintain all these things, just as every one of its competitors does. It’s an impossible task but just as impossible to compete with; you can’t build social products without building an entire social graph from scratch, and good luck with that.\\n\\nIn a fediverse world, rather than try to build another all-encompassing Facebook from scratch, an enterprising developer can pick one or a few of its features and try to do better. Users can pick their favorite app — or two, or two hundred — through which to get their posts. Because everything is based on one set of posts and an open network of friends and followers, new social products can be useful even if you’re the very first user.\\n\\nImage: W3C\\n\\nIn the world of ActivityPub, every post everywhere is made up of a sender, a message, and a URL. Every user has an inbox and an outbox for those messages. That’s the whole protocol in a nutshell. The simplicity is the point: since ActivityPub is not a product but a data format like PDF or JPG, what you do with those messages, those URLs, those inboxes and outboxes, is entirely up to you.\\n\\nYou could have a Twitter-like app that emphasizes text, or an Instagram-like one with a UI that shows photos first. Your federated YouTube could be full of everybody’s videos, or you could make TikTok by filtering only for short and vertical ones. You could use a WhatsApp-style messaging app that only cares about messages sent directly to someone’s inbox.\\n\\nYou could try to do all those things, or you could try to do something nobody’s ever been able to do before. You could build a news reader that only includes posts with links to news sites and automatically loads those links in a nice reading interface. You could build a content moderation tool that any fediverse app could use to filter and manage content on their platform. You could build the perfect algorithm that only up-ranks shitposts and good jokes, and license that algorithm to any app that wants a “Epic Posts Only” mode. You could build an app that’s just an endless feed of great stuff for NBA fans. You could build one that’s just for crypto true believers. You could build one that lets you swipe from one to the other depending on your mood.\\n\\nThere are already a few platforms built on ActivityPub and embracing the ideas of the fediverse. Apps like Mammoth and Ivory are showing the potential for different user experiences on top of the same data and infrastructure. But so far we’re mostly in the “popular app, but federated” phase of this transition. (Which is definitely better than “popular app, but blockchain” from a couple of years ago… but not by much.)\\n\\nSo far we’re mostly in the “popular app, but federated” phase of this transition\\n\\nMastodon deliberately looks and feels like Twitter. (So do Firefish and Pleroma and GoToSocial and others. The fediverse is super into replacing Twitter.) Pixelfed is Instagram through and through. Lemmy’s features are virtually all ripped straight from Reddit. Almost everything in the fediverse is a one-to-one competitor to an existing platform: PeerTube to YouTube; Friendica to Facebook; BookWyrm to Goodreads; on and on it goes. Some of these apps are very good! But nearly all of them are differentiated only in that they’re federated.\\n\\nLet’s be super clear about this: the point of the fediverse is not that it’s federated. The most consistent argument against the long-term viability of platforms like Mastodon is that most people don’t give a hoot about the underlying protocols and infrastructure of their apps and just want things to be easy, reliable, and useful. That is absolutely, unequivocally true. Making the “It’s federated!” argument is like making the “It’s better for privacy!” argument: it makes you feel good, and at best it’s a useful tiebreaker, but it doesn’t actually matter. All that matters is the product.\\n\\nThe best thing about the fediverse is that it will actually enable an explosion of better social products, for lots of reasons but one in particular: it allows for so many more of them.\n",

      "Meta could also potentially face pressure to lower the subscription fee to make it more more affordable for users to deny tracking. (Just spitballing here but imagine if it were offering a choice of tracking ads vs paying €1 a year not to be tracked which wouldn’t look so evidently self-serving.)\\n\\nAsked whether the issue for consumer protection authorities is the ‘pay or consent’ choice Meta is offering or how it’s gone about implementing it, BEUC’s spokesman said the questions are hard to separate as they’re “closely interlinked”.\\n\\n“Under consumer law, you need an informed and fair choice to purchase such a subscription. The first question is also dependent on compliance with data protection law. If the practice infringes the GDPR, the fact that it infringes a law which aims to protect fundamental rights should in our opinion be considered unfair and illegal under consumer law too,” he told us, adding: “In any case, the choice is designed in a way that is unfair, aggressive and misleading.”\\n\\nThe European Commission itself has an additional oversight role on Meta directly as the company is also subject to the EU’s shiny new Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA). In the latter case its social networks, Facebook and Instagram, were designated as very large online platforms (VLOPs) earlier this year. And, since late August, they’ve been expected to be compliant with that digital rulebook.\\n\\nBoth pan-EU laws put restrictions on the use of personal data for advertising — explicitly requiring consent is obtained from users for such a purpose; and that consent must be as easy to withhold as to affirm. So one issue the Commission — which is the sole enforcer of the DSA on VLOPs — might weigh in in the coming months on is whether clicking accept vs digging out a credit card to pay a monthly charge are equivalently easy.\\n\\nThe regulation also contains provisions which are intended to combat unfair/deceptive design, such as targeting choice interfaces that make it “more difficult or time-consuming” to pick one option over another. Although the DSA’s provisions against dark patterns are only intended to be applied where consumer protection and privacy laws, which also take aim against unfair choices, don’t.\"\n",

      "\"body\": \"Meta wants to shift the burden of monitoring social media usage among teens back to the app stores — and to parents. In a blog post published today, Meta’s global head of Safety, Antigone Davis, argues that parents should be responsible for approving their teens’ app downloads and staked Meta’s position in supporting federal legislation that would require parental approval for app downloads for users under the age of 16.\\n\\nGuiding its reasoning, Meta pointed to recent Pew research that indicated that 81% of U.S. adults were in favor of requiring parental consent for teens to create social media accounts. While this may speak to popular opinion around parental sentiment, it doesn’t mean that parents have thought through who should be responsible for preventing or allowing teens’ access to social media, or how those apps should operate to protect teens.\\n\\nA coalition of 42 states and D.C. are currently suing Meta over its harms to teens and young users, in part referencing findings from Meta whistleblower Frances Haugen. The former employee had provided to news outlets a treasure trove of documents that appeared to indicate Meta understood the harms it was causing — including things like body image issues among teens — but didn’t take action. Instagram head Adam Mosseri was later hauled before Congress in December 2021 to defend the app’s teen safety record, but so far, legislators have not come to any decision about how to regulate teen usage of these platforms.\\n\\nInstead, Meta began regulating itself, adding new defaults and features that would restrict teens’ access to content on its apps, protect their privacy and limit ad targeting to teens, as well as introducing parental controls.\\n\\nIn more recent weeks, a second Meta whistleblower, Arturo Bejar, has come forward to express concerns that Instagram’s approach to protecting teens wasn’t working to keep them safe from sexual predators and unwanted sexual advances and harassment. Hired as a consultant on the matter, Bejar eventually blew the whistle on Meta after seeing issues remain unresolved following years of work.\n",

      "“We are the first ones in the world to have a horizontal legislation that has this direction on fundamental rights, that supports the development of AI in our continent, and that is up to date to the frontier of the artificial intelligence with the most powerful models under clear obligation. So I think we delivered.”\\n\\n“We have always been questioned whether there is enough protection, whether there is enough stimulant for innovation in this text, and I can say, this balance is there,” added Tudorache. “We have safeguards, we have all the provisions that we need, the redress that we need in giving trust to our citizens in the interaction with AI, in the products in the services that they will interact with from now on.\\n\\n“We now have to use this blueprint to seek now global convergence because this is a global challenge for everyone. And I think that with the work that we’ve done, as difficult as it was — and it was difficult, this was a marathon negotiation by all standards, looking at all precedents so far — but I think we delivered.”\\n\\nThe EU’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, also chipped in with his two euro-cents — describing the agreement clinched a little before midnight Brussels’ time as “historic”. “It is a full package. It is a complete deal. And this is why we spent so much time,” he intoned. “This is balancing user safety, innovation for startups, while also respecting… our fundamental rights and our European values.”\\n\\nClear road ahead?\\n\\nDespite the EU very visibly patting itself on the back tonight on securing a deal on ‘world-first’ AI rules, it’s not quite yet the end of the road for the bloc’s lawmaking process as there are still some formal steps to go — not least the final text will face votes in the parliament and the Council to adopt it. But given how much division and disagreement there has been over how (or even whether) to regulate AI the biggest obstacles have been dismantled with this political deal and the path to passing the EU AI Act in the coming months looks clear.\\n\\nThe Commission is certainly projecting confidence. Per Breton, work to implement the agreement starts immediately with the set up of an AI Office within the EU’s executive — which will have the job of coordinating with the Member State oversight bodies that will need to enforce the rules on AI firms; and overseeing the most advanced AI models, including by contributing to fostering standards and testing practices. A scientific panel of independent experts will be appointed to advise the AI Office about GPAI models. “We will welcome new colleagues… a lot of them,” said Breton. “We will work — starting tomorrow — to get ready.”\\n\\nOpposition to the inclusion in the AI package of tiered rules for general purpose AIs has been led, in recent weeks, by France — and French AI startup Mistral, which had been lobbying for a total carve out from obligations for foundational models/GPAIs. In the event the deal agreed by the Spanish presidency does contain some obligations for GPAIs and foundation models. So it’s not the total carve out Mistral and its lobbyists have been pushing for.\\n\\nResponding to news of the political deal last night, France’s digital minister’s office put out a statement attributed to Jean-Noël Barrot which said (translated from French using AI): “We will be carefully analyzing the compromise reached today, and in the coming weeks we will ensure that the text preserves Europe’s ability to develop its own artificial intelligence technologies, and safeguards its strategic autonomy.”\\n\\nIt remains unclear how much of a carve out Mistral’s business might enjoy under the deal agreed. Asked about this during the press conference, Artigas suggested the French AI startup would — once commercialized — be likely to fit in the “low tier” for GPAIs, meaning it would have only limited transparency obligations, since she said it does not hit the high capacity compute threshold triggering the systemic risk obligations (as she said it’s using what’s thought to be 10^23 of compute, not 10^25).\\n\\nHowever, as Mistral is currently still in an R&D and pre-training phase for their models, she said they would be excluded from even the low tier compliance requirements.\\n\\nThis report was updated to include the response from the French digital ministry; link to the Council’s PR; and with additional details from the presser — including remarks about how the law might apply to Mistral.\n",

      "So when we say facilitate, it’s obvious that the EU officials discuss what kind of experts will be available from this particular stakeholder to attend these meetings and to present the point of view, which seems to be a privileged access,” he explained.\\n\\n“Also in the same email thread there’s mention of EU officials being allocated to specifically attend the cooperation between the stakeholder and DG-Home on the proposal, which to our understanding is something that goes way beyond the level of consultations or exchange of views or exchange of opinions on the proposal and speaks directly to cooperation.”\\n\\nThe committee took the opportunity to press Johansson about her contacts with companies and other lobbyists during the drafting of the CSAM-proposal, with MEPs saying they want clear answers to the allegations of commercial interest and heavy lobbying when the Commission was setting up and drafting the proposal.\\n\\nIn the event MEPs got some bare bones detail.\\n\\nAsked for a list of these contacts, the commissioner responded that she’d met with Google six times; Microsoft, Meta and TikTok three times each; twice with Twitter (X); and once apiece with Apple and Amazon. She also said she’d met with the child safety organizations Thorn (twice) and Brave Movement (twice); and with Tech Alliance and ICANN once apiece.\\n\\nIn wider responses related to concerns about how much commercial interest had influenced the Commission, Johansson highlighted her decision for the CSAM-scanning proposal to be “technology neutral” — meaning the draft regulation does not support any specific tech solution — with the suggestion being EU lawmakers had resisted lobbying by companies for a law that would explicitly favor their existing tech tools.\\n\\nShe also denied that only Thorn and Microsoft have technology “that is necessary for the scanning” — claiming that’s “absolutely not true”.\\n\\n“There are no specific technologies mentioned [in the proposal] and I think this is an important part. So there’s no specific technology that’s been favoured in this proposal,” she also told the committee, adding: “So many technologies are being developed all the time — while we are speaking — and they will continue to develop. So I think it’s important that the legislation has to be technology neutral.”\\n\\nEarlier this week a seminar organized by the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), an advisory body to the Commission on data protection law, heard from more than 20 speakers across civil society, academia and industry expressing deep misgivings about the Commission’s approach — including a warning from the EDPS himself that the EU could be at a tipping point for freedom and democracy if it does not turn back from the plan to do non-targeted scanning of private messages.\\n\\nJohansson had been invited to participate in the seminar but declined to attend. She didn’t offer a direct response to the EDPS’ concerns today but she did counter a number of arguments heard at the session earlier in the week — including refuting the suggestion that her proposal amounts to mass surveillance.\\n\\n“My proposal would not mean that all communication will be scanned. Compared to the situation today it will be much more limited,” she claimed, referencing the temporary ePrivacy derogation that currently gives messaging firms a legal basis to scan non-encrypted content for CSAM (but is intended to be replaced by the proposed regulation which, critics contend, will force platforms to scan end-to-end encrypted content too). “Today companies are allowed to scan if they search for child sexual abuse material. That’s why we receive these 5.2 million videos and pictures and grooming attempts — 70% from private communication. If my proposal is adopted, this will be limited.”\\n\\nShe also emphasized how the proposal first requires in-scope platforms to deploy prevention measures to try to stop the spread of CSAM and/or prevent abuse of their tools by people intent on abusing children. “First comes prevention. Only if prevention is not enough, then you might be allowed to do detection — but only after a court decision,” she said.\\n\\n“So only those that really cannot deal with the problem with mitigating measures… and only after a court decision and only during a specific period they will be allowed to do the detection,” she went on. “We will also limit the reporting so that we will also receive fewer but hopefully better reports.”\\n\\nJohansson’s arguments to MEPs that her proposal does not overreach also lent on the existence of other EU laws — such as the bloc’s data protection framework — which she suggested will act as balancing checks on the scope of possible CSAM-scanning. “It’s also important that we continue to comply with all relevant legislation. For example the GDPR and other requirements, there are no derogation from that in my proposal,” she said.\\n\\n“It’s also important — and I know that’s been part of the debate — that it should not be a slippery slope,” she added.\n",

      "That will give Verdane not only the stake in Meltwater, but also a stake in Jobylon and whatever else Fountain and Lyseggen find interesting. That will, in turn, de-leverage a focus on just one business. Verdane itself has only recently started to spread its wings to invest in startups across all of Europe and beyond: tying up with a partner to help direct it is a very de-risked approach to take while trying to be more ambitious.\\n\\nIn terms of technology, companies like Meltwater are at a crossroads these days. The company would have had its roots out of the businesses where humans would have physically sifted through piles of newspapers, daily, to clip mentions of a company’s name, collate those and send them on to those clients to help them better track how they are being covered in the media.\\n\\nThe decline of print media digitized that effort, and then the rise of social media turned that into a wider game, sentiment analysis, and words became structured, and more usually unstructured data. The influx of a whole new set of tools to glean insight out of that data turned a media challenge into a technical one. Meltwater built AI in-house and has acquired a stream of businesses in an analytics consolidation play. (The most high-profile of these acquisitions undoubtedly was DataSift, the groundbreaking firm that was an early friend of Twitter’s in monetizing its firehose only for that relationship to turn sour.)\\n\\nBut now, it has a much bigger competitive threat: Companies like OpenAI and innovations in generative AI will change the game again in terms of search — consumer and enterprise — and how any kind of business intelligence work gets carried out.\\n\\nLyseggen, unsurprisingly, believes that although Meltwater’s focus feels a bit like a throwback to a problem that has now essentially been fixed — and may well be made more efficient by would-be competitors — he thinks there is more opportunity for his company regardless.\\n\\n“I consider OpenAI’s ChatGPT the ‘Netscape moment’ in ushering in this new era,” he said. That’s an interesting thing to say: Netscape certainly changed how the world looks for information, although it’s far from being part of what we use today. “AI is changing the game for players to challenge the old guard. I think Meltwater’s tech stock is already the most modern and AI-centric in its category. We will continue to invest in AI and that’s something we are very excited about. We are pushing very hard.” Meltwater today says it analyzes around 1 billion documents daily for clients in communications, marketing and PR.\"\n",

      "secondary legislation). It also said the idea is for the FLOPs threshold to be combined, over time, with “other benchmarks” that will be developed by a new expert oversight body to be set up within the Commission, called the AI Office.\\n\\nWhy was 25 FLOPs selected as the high risk threshold for GPAIs? The Commission suggests the figure was picked with the intention of capturing current gen frontier models. However it claimed lawmakers did not discuss nor even considered whether it would apply to any models currently in play, such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 or Google’s Gemini, during the marathon trilogues to agree the final shape of the rulebook.\\n\\nA Commission official added that it will, in any case, be up to makers of GPAIs to self assess whether their models meet the FLOPs threshold and, therefore, whether they fall under the rules for GPAIs “with systemic risk” or not.\\n\\n“There are no official sources that will say ChatGPT or Gemini or Chinese models are at this level of FLOPs,” the official said during the press briefing. “On the basis of the information we have and with this 10^25 that we have chosen we have chosen a number that could really capture, a little bit, the frontier models that we have. Whether this is capturing GPT-4 or Gemini or others we are not here now to assert — because also, in our framework, it is the companies that would have to come and self assess what the amount of FLOPs or the computing capacity they have used. But, of course, if you read the scientific literature, many will point to these numbers as being very much the most advanced models at the moment. We will see what the companies will assess because they’re the best placed to make this assessment.”\\n\\n“The rules have not been written keeping in mind certain companies,” they added. “They’ve really been written with the idea of defining the threshold — which, by the way, may change because we have the possibility to be empowered to change this threshold on the basis of technological evolution. It could go up, it could go down and we could also develop other benchmarks that in the future will be the more appropriate to benchmark the different moments.”\\n\\nGPAIs that fall in the AI Act’s high risk tier will face ex ante-style regulatory requirements to assess and mitigate systemic risks — meaning they must proactively test model outputs to shrink risks of actual (or “reasonably foreseeable”) negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights, or for society as a whole.\\n\\nWhile “low tier” GPAIs will only face lighter transparency requirements, including obligations to apply watermarking to generative AI outputs.\\n\\nThe watermarking requirement for GPAIs falls in an article that was in the original Commission version of the risk-based framework, presented all the way back in April 2021, which focused on transparency requirements for technologies such as AI chatbots and deepfakes — but which will now also apply generally to general purpose AI systems.\\n\\n“There is an obligation to try to watermark [generative AI-produced] text on the basis of the latest state of the art technology that is available,” the Commission official said, fleshing out details of the agreed watermarking obligations. “At the moment, technologies are much better at watermarking videos and audio than watermarking text. But what we ask is the fact that this watermarking takes place on the basis of state of the art technology — and then we expect, of course, that over time the technology will mature and will be as [good] as possible.”\\n\\nGPAI model makers must also commit to respecting EU copyright rules, including complying with an existing machine readable opt-out from text and data mining contained in the EU Copyright Directive — and a carve-out of the Act’s transparency requirements for open source GPAIs does not extend to cutting them loose from the copyright obligations, with the Commission confirming the Copyright Directive will still apply on open source GPAIs.\\n\\nAs regards the AI Office, which will play a key role in setting risk classification thresholds for GPAIs, the Commission confirmed there’s no budget nor headcount defined for the expert body as yet. (Although, in the small hours of Saturday morning the bloc’s internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, suggested the EU is set to welcome “a lot” of new colleagues as it tools up this general purpose AI oversight body.)\\n\\nAsked about resourcing for the AI Office, a Commission official said it will be decided in the future by the EU’s executive taking “an appropriate and official decision”. “The idea is that we can create a dedicated budget line for the Office and that we will be able also to recruit the national experts from Member States if we wish to on top of contractual agents and on top of permanent staff.\n",

      "But it’s a controversial view and only possible from a position of credibility, which means central banks would likely have to get inflation back to 2% first.\\n\\n“It would be a mistake of the first order to think you can change a goal you have set if you can’t achieve it,” according to Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel.\\n\\nGlobal trends suggest inflation will be stronger than in the past, with former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney among those saying rates won’t return to pre-pandemic lows.\\n\\nOne lesson Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s No. 2 official, draws from the latest inflation episode is that policymakers mustn’t assume that looking through supply shocks — as text books suggest — is the optimal response. She recommends they be ready to react preemptively, even when inflation hasn’t yet spun out of control.\\n\\nThey may be called into action soon on that front, should an escalation in the conflict in the Middle East hit oil deliveries.\\n\\nWhen the next big global slowdown comes, though, flexibility may be needed the other way. Europe’s eight-year experiment with negative rates ended with mixed reviews last summer as to whether it was all worth it.\\n\\nThe Bank for International Settlements argues that there’s room for greater tolerance for moderate shortfalls even if they’re persistent, because “low-inflation regimes, in contrast to high-inflation ones, have self-stabilizing properties.”\\n\\nRethinking Quantitative Easing\\n\\nWith a more flexible approach to those 2% targets, monetary policy after the 2008 financial crisis would have looked very different in many parts of the world. Trillions of dollars, euros, yen and pounds of asset purchases did little to raise prices in the face of global disinflationary forces until governments used the money they raised to stuff cash into consumers’ pockets during Covid lockdowns.\\n\\nBut that’s also been blamed for distorting financial markets. Episodes such as the Silicon Valley Bank blow-up are seen by some as a direct result of central bank reserves creation under QE, along with regulatory and supervision failures.\\n\\nOnly 40% of economists surveyed predict central banks will use QE the same way as they did before. A quarter expect them to deploy it more sparingly, about 30% see its only role going forward as a tool to address financial-stability concerns and a small minority doesn’t see it being used again at all.\\n\\nThere are other problems with bond-buying that may affect how it’s used in the future. QE effectively swaps long-term borrowing costs for short-term ones. What’s been a lucrative deal for taxpayers when official interest rates were low has now turned into a disastrous trade.\\n\\nThe clearest depiction of the problem is in the UK, where the BOE secured taxpayer indemnity for any losses on QE. Over the next decade, it estimates, its purchases will cost the government over £200 billion ($243 billion).\\n\\nAnd policymakers have little experience in unwinding their balance sheets, where small mistakes can trigger big market turbulence.\\n\\nThe Fed experienced some of that when it tried to shrink bond holdings between 2017 and 2019. More recent efforts to reduce portfolios have progressed rather smoothly, partially because central banks have amassed so much debt over the years that they’re far away from any thresholds that would trigger a squeeze.\\n\\nBut the fact that they’re treating quantitative tightening as a technical adjustment rather than a part of their efforts to conquer inflation raises questions about the future use of a tool that’s only trusted to work one way.\\n\\nThe ECB faces an extra legal burden on bond holdings that comes with operating in a currency union of 20 countries. Concerns around illegally financing governments and debt mutualization have already landed the central bank in court several times.\\n\\nMixing Policies\\n\\nLow interest rates and large-scale QE programs allowed treasuries to borrow on the cheap to finance stimulus campaigns, protecting labor markets, businesses and consumers from collapse. But the spending blowout throughout and since the pandemic — part critical emergency funding, part political need to show an all-hands-on-deck approach in crisis — contributed to the latest outbreak in inflation.\\n\\nWhile the same kind of pulling in the same direction is needed to restrain demand, many governments are concerned that if they tighten policy too hard, voters will kick them out and replace them with populists or extremists.\n",

      "T7 shield -> Comes with -> Rubberized exterior\n",
      "\n",
      "They're fast enough for every camera that I've ever tested for WIRED, and I've never had any issue with them after years of life being tossed around in various camera bags.\\n\\nI remain puzzled as to why CFexpress cards are so dang expensive, but they are and if your camera uses them (and most modern, high-end video cameras do) this is about as good of a deal as we've ever seen.\\n\\nSanDisk 2-TB Extreme Portable SSD Photograph: Amazon\\n\\nOur favorite speedy portable SSD, the SanDisk is lightweight, with IP22-rated enclosures so it'll stand up to life on the go. I have been using this drive to make weekly backups for almost two years now and have had no issues. That said, our friends at Ars Technica, and other users around the web, have noted extremely high failure rates with this drive, mainly with the 2- and 4-TB versions. SanDisk has issued a firmware update, which seems to fix the problem.\\n\\nSamsung's T7 external solid-state drives are among the WIRED gear team's favorites. Lightning fast and reliable, solid-state drives take less babying than hard drives. The T7 Shield comes with a rubberized exterior to protect it from drops and impacts, and it's also IP65 water- and dust-resistant. It comes with a USB-C cable, fits in the palm of your hand, and doesn't require an external power source. Product reviewer Matt Jancer has been using several T7s and T7 Shields for three years and has never had even a hiccup. Other capacities are also on sale.\\n\\nCanon SELPHY QX10 Portable Square Photo Printer Photograph: Amazon\\n\\nSeveral WIRED staffers love this little printer that outputs perfectly-sized, small-but-not too-small, Polaroid-like images. Though technically it costs $150, this printer has been hovering at $129 lately, but $78 is still a solid deal. This price is for the black but the other colors are discounted to $99. The larger Canon SELPHY CP1500 printer we tried is also on sale for $99. That's also a solid price, but not uncommon.\\n\\nTravel and Outdoor Deals\\n\\nPhotograph: Amazon\\n\\nI (Matt Jancer) have wheeled, lifted, and slung around a lot of budget bags over dozens of trips across the globe, and the Maxlite is the one I recommend as the best budget suitcase. It's lightweight at 5.4 pounds, reasonably well made compared to the competition, and stands up to the cargo bellies of aircraft without anything more than scuff marks. For a carry-on, the two-wheel rollaboard is my preference, since it offers more interior space than a four-wheel spinner.\\n\\nHydro Flask routinely make some of our favorite insulated water bottles. Most insulated travel mugs these days can keep ice water cold and hot coffee warm. What makes Hydro Flask stand out is the durability of their powder coating. I've (Matt Jancer) knocked several around for years in gyms, at the base of rock climbing walls outdoors, and rolling around the floorboards of my old car and have never managed to scratch or dent one yet.\\n\\nThis electric bike has good looks, strong acceleration, and a better price point than the competition, especially right now with the major sale Wing is having. It's got a built-in headlight and taillight, comfortable hand grips, and a nicer seat than you'd expect. It checks a lot of boxes at its higher price point, so this is a great time to jump on this deal.\\n\\nWhen Is Amazon Prime Big Deal Days?\\n\\nAmazon's second big sale event runs from Tuesday, October 10 through Wednesday, October 11, 2023. It ends at 2:59 am ET on October 11 (11:59 pm PT).\\n\\nWill You Need a Prime Membership?\\n\\nYes, this event is for Amazon Prime members, meaning most of these Prime Day deals are for subscribers only. If you want to take the ride you need to buy the ticket. In this case, the ticket is $15 a month, and you get free two-day shipping. There are a whole bunch of other Prime Day perks you can take advantage of as well. You can also sign up for a 30-day Amazon Prime trial. Just register before the event and cancel right when the trial ends so you can take advantage of these deals. That said, there are a lot of discounted products available to folks who are not Prime subscribers.\n",
